Pick the appropriate subscription and make sure to create a resource name. It can be anything but the name cannot be spaced apart. Region can be anywhere but for this example, we will use "East US 2".

# ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Configuration
These next steps will show the settings used to create the virtual machine.

### Basics Tab
> **Subscription**

Choose the appriopriate subscription.

> **Resource Group**

Resource group have to be the same name created as shown in the previous steps "Pick-a-name-of-your-choosing".

> **Virtual machine name**

Virtual name can be anything. For this setup, I have simply chosen "Virtual1".

> **Region**

Region will have to be the same as created in Resource Groups. This one is "East US 2".

> **Availability options**

Leave as is.

> **Security type**

Leave as is.

Choose x64.

> **Size**

Choose "Standard_D2as_v4 - 2 vcpus, 8 GiB memory ($70.08/month)"


> **Username & Password**

Username and Password can of course be anything you want, just make sure that the password creation follows the standards. To be transparent, I simply used Password123! though it isn't ideal in a real world setting.
